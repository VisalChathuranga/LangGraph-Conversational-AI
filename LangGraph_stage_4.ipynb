My mentor suggested I learn \\nGit to manage my project efficiently. He didn 't hold a formal session but guided me on how to start, \\nexplained the basics, and shared valuable learning resources. \\nGit is a widely used distributed version control system in software development. Unlike centralized \\nsystems, Git allows each developer to have a complete copy of the codebase on their local machine, \\nknown as a clone. This setup enables developers to work on their own branches, make changes, and \\nsafely commit them back to the main repository, minimizing conflicts and data loss risks. \\nA key concept in Git is commits, which are snapshots of the codebase at specific times, capturing all \\nchanges made since the last commit. Commits are immutable, ensuring the integrity and security of the \\ncodebase history. \\nGit also excels in managing branches and merges. Branches allow developers to work independently on \\ndifferent versions of the codebase. When merging changes from one branch to another, Git uses a three-\\nway merge algorithm to intelligently combine changes and resolve conflicts, ensuring the codebas e \\nremains consistent even with multiple developers working simultaneously. \\nIn summary, Git is a robust tool that provides developers with powerful features for managing and \\ncollaborating on complex software projects.\"),\n",

These issues \\nrange from the corners being misshapen to layers of plastic appearing on the surface. The situation \\nbecomes more complicated when stickers are applied. These stickers, which are imported, often \\nexacerbate the defects, introducing new issues such as improper alignment and intrinsic flaws within the \\nstickers themselves. Addressing these defects manually is both labor -intensive and time -consuming, \\nrequiring significant financial investment. In response to these challenges, a soph isticated machine has \\nbeen developed. This machine uses four strategically positioned cameras to thoroughly inspect each \\nAstra cup, identifying and cataloging defects with precision. This innovative solution aims to \\nsignificantly reduce the reliance on human labor and increase the efficiency and accuracy of the quality \\ncontrol process.

In this project, Flask \\nserves as the API layer that handles the communication between the front-end (Electron.js) and \\nthe machine learning models responsible for making predictions. The back -end processes the \\ndata sent from the front-end, runs it through the trained models, and then returns the predicted \\nresults. \\nThe machine learning models used in this project are hosted on t he back-end. These models \\nare trained to predict the optimal settings for the reflow oven based on the data entered by the \\nuser. The Flask API is designed to handle POST requests from the front -end, meaning that \\nwhen the user submits data (such as PCB dime nsions and temperature profiles), the back-end \\nreceives this information and passes it to the machine learning models for processing. \\nOnce the models have completed their predictions, the results are sent back to the front-end to \\nbe displayed in the Prediction Window. Communication between the front -end and back-end \\nis managed through IPC (Inter-Process Communication) events, ensuring smooth and real-time \\ndata exchange. This system architecture allows the front -end to remain responsive while \\nwaiting for predictions from the back-end. \\nThe Python code for running the server is written in server.py. This script initializes the Flask \\nserver, which listens on port 5000 for incoming requests. The server is responsible for loading \\nthe machine learning models, processing the user’s input, generating predictions, and sending \\nthe results back to the front-end.'),\n",

These include: \\n• Length of the PCB: The PCB’s length, measured in millimeters (mm), determines how \\nthe board absorbs heat in the reflow oven. \\n• Width of the PCB : The width, also in millimeters (mm), influences heat distribution \\nacross the PCB. \\n• Copper Thickness (Inner and Outer Layers): Refers to the thickness of copper in the \\nPCB layers. Both inner and outer layer thicknesses are critical for multi-layer PCBs, as \\ncopper\\'s thermal conductivity affects heat absorption properties. \\n• Number of Layers: Indicates the number of conductive layers in the PCB. Single-layer \\nto multi -layer PCBs vary in thermal properties, impacting heat distribut ion during \\nsoldering. \\nAdditional Features: \\nThe Main Window also includes an Open PCB Data  button, enabling users to access \\npreviously recorded PCB data stored in an Excel file.

This \\nfunctionality makes managing and updating PCB records more efficient, eliminating the need \\nto manually navigate through extensive datasets. \\nOptional Inputs: \\nOther optional fields, such as the type of solder  paste or additional PCB attributes, can be \\nprovided to refine predictions further. These inputs influence factors like heat absorption and \\ndissipation, adding to the accuracy of the results. \\nUser Guidance and Validation: \\nThe Main Window provides clearly l abeled input fields with guidance for each parameter to \\nminimize errors or confusion.

Each point represents a specific stage in the \\nreflow process: \\n• T1 to T5 : Typically represent the preheat and soak stages , where the PCB and its \\ncomponents are gradually heated to ensure uniform temperature distribution and to \\nactivate the flux in the solder paste. \\n• T6 to T8 : Represent the actual reflow stage , where the PCB reaches the pea k \\ntemperature required to melt the solder paste and form the necessary connections. \\n• T9 to T10: Represent the cooling phase, where the temperature gradually decreases, \\nallowing the solder to solidify and form a stable joint. \\nFigure 3.6 :  Main Window'),\n",

Once all the necessary PCB parameters and temperature \\nprofile data have been provided in the previous windows, the machine learning models \\nprocess this data to generate predictions for four critical reflow oven parameters: \\n \\n1. Max Rising Slope : The maximum temperature rise per unit of time during the \\nheating phase of the reflow process. A controlled temperature rise is important to \\nprevent thermal stress on components. \\n2. Soak Time: The time during which the PCB is held at a consistent temperature \\nbefore reaching peak temperature. This is crucial for activating the flux and \\nensuring the sol- der paste is adequately prepared for reflow. \\n3. Reflow Time: The duration during which the PCB is exposed to peak temperature, \\nen- suring that the solder melts and forms reliable connections between \\ncomponents. \\n4. Peak Temperature: The highest temperature the PCB reaches during the reflow \\npro- cess. This is the temperature at which the solde r melts and creates the \\nnecessary bonds between components and the PCB. \\n \\nTo enhance usability, each predicted value is color-coded based on whether it falls within \\nthe optimal range for the selected solder paste type. Predictions that are within the \\nacceptable range are displayed in green, while those that exceed or fall short of safe \\nthresholds are  shown in red. This visual cue provides immediate feedback, allowing \\noperators to quickly identify areas that require adjustment without having to interpret raw \\nnumerical values. \\n \\nThe Prediction Window presents these values in a clear, easy -to-read format, with each \\npre- diction displayed alongside a description of what it represents and how it should be \\nused to adjust the reflow oven settings. For example: \\n \\n• If the Max Rising Slope exceeds a safe threshold, the system may flag this as a \\npo- tential issue, recommending that the user reduce the oven’s ramp -up rate to \\nprevent damage to sensitive components. \\n• If the Peak Temperature is too high, the system may suggest lowering it to avoid \\noverheating, which can cause solder defects. \\n \\nIn addition to displaying the predicted values, the system may offer recommendations \\non how to adjust oven settings or alert users if the predicted values fall outside of typical \\nindustry standards. The intuitive color-coding feature enables operators to make informed \\ndecisions more efficiently, minimizing the need for trial and error. \\n \\nThe Prediction Window also incorporates options for users to save the prediction results \\nor export them for  future reference. This allows users to document the predictions for \\ndifferent PCBs or production batches, providing a historical log that can help in \\noptimizing future runs.'),\n",

This approach seemed ideal at first since all  outputs were \\ninterrelated, and handling them together could potentially save computational resources and \\nreduce the overall complexity of the workflow. \\nHowever, during testing and training, the multi-output model showed significant limitations. \\nThe main issue was that each target output (such as Soak Time and Reflow Time) exhibited \\nvarying levels of variance and complexity. As a result: \\n• Soak Time and Reflow Time had higher variability, making them harder to predict \\naccurately within the combined model. \\n• Max Rising Slope and Peak Temperature had relatively more consistent relationships \\nwith the input features but were still negatively affected by the complexities introduced \\nby the other outputs. \\nThis complexity led to high variance in the predictions, meaning  that the model sometimes \\nprovided inconsistent results. For example, the predicted Soak Time could vary significantly \\nacross similar inputs, even when other outputs were relatively stable. This inconsistency was \\nparticularly problematic for the Soak Time and Reflow Time predictions, which are critical in \\ncontrolling the reflow process. \\nAdditionally, the multi-output architecture made it harder to optimize the model. Changes that \\nbenefited one target variable often had a negative effect on others. This resulted in suboptimal \\nperformance for all predictions, making it difficult to balance and tune the model for each \\nspecific parameter. The overfitting issue was also more pronounced in the Soak Time model, \\nas the complexity of the multi-output regression caused the model to overfit the training data, \\nleading to poor generalization on unseen data. \\n \\nFigure 3.8 :  Prediction Window'),\n",

This transition \\nsignificantly improved the overall system’s performance and addressed the issues of variance \\nand overfitting. \\nIn a single-output architecture: \\n• Each model could be independently optimized for its specific target variable, allowing \\nfor more focused training and tuning. \\n• The models could now handle the varying levels of complexity across the different \\noutputs. For instance, the Soak Time model could be adjusted to manage the higher \\nvariability without negatively impacting the other predictions. \\n• Overfitting was reduced, particularly for the Soak Time and Reflow Time models, as \\nthe introduction of dropout layers and  separate architectures for each output allowed \\nfor more flexible adjustments. \\nKey Benefits of Transitioning to Single-Output Models: \\n• Improved Accuracy: By training individual models for each parameter, the overall \\naccuracy of the predictions improved dram atically. The Soak Time and Reflow Time \\nmodels, in particular, benefited from having specialized architectures that could handle \\ntheir unique patterns. As a result, predictions became more reliable across all outputs. \\n• Reduced Overfitting: The single-output models allowed for specific dropout layers to \\nbe introduced in the architectures. Dropout layers randomly deactivate neurons during \\ntraining, which forces the models to learn more generalized patterns rather than \\noverfitting to the training data. For the Soak Time  model, this was particularly \\nbeneficial, reducing the tendency to memorize the training data and improving \\nperformance on new, unseen data. \\n• More Control Over Tuning: Each single-output model was independently optimized \\nusing Keras Tuner , which al lowed for more granular control  over important \\nhyperparameters like the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, learning \\nrates, and batch sizes. This flexibility enabled each model to be fine-tuned specifically \\nfor its target variable. For example: \\no The Max Rising Slope model was optimized to focus on smoother predictions \\nwith fewer layers but more neurons per layer. \\no The Soak Time model, which had more variability, was designed with more \\nlayers and higher dropout rates to prevent overfitting. \\nBy transitioning to single-output models, the entire prediction system became more modular, \\nmaking it easier to maintain and improve individual models over time. If a particular model’s \\nperformance was unsatisfactory, only that model needed to be retrained or modified, rather \\nthan adjusting the entire system. \\nImproved Computational Efficiency : Despite each target now having its own model, the \\nsystem’s overall training and inference times  were reduced.

This will \\nenhance the system’s  robustness and ensure it performs well across a wider \\nvariety of PCB configurations and production scenarios. \\n \\n2. User Interface Enhancements: \\n \\nWhile the current user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, there is \\npotential to introduce more interactive features that improve the user experience. \\nFor example: \\n \\no Real-time error handling : Adding error -handling mechanisms that c an \\ndetect and provide feedback on incorrect or out -of-range input data will \\nhelp users avoid mistakes and ensure the accuracy of predictions. \\no Visualization tools : Including more detailed visualizations of the input \\ndata (such as temperature curves, conveyo r speed profiles, or PCB \\ndimensions) and prediction results can give users a clearer understanding \\nof how their inputs affect the reflow oven settings. \\no Guided workflows: Future updates could include step -by-step guides to \\nhelp new users understand how to i nput data and interpret the model \\npredictions, making the system more accessible to less experienced  \\noperators. \\n \\n3. Integration with More PCB Parameters: \\n \\nThe current system focuses on key parameters such as PCB dimensions, copper  \\nthickness, and temperature p rofiles, but there is potential for further \\nenhancement. Future iterations could incorporate additional PCB -specific \\nfeatures, enabling more refined and accurate predictions.  \\n \\nSome potential enhancements include: \\no Solder Paste Types and Characteristics :Different solder pastes have \\nunique melting points, flow characteristics, and cooling rates. Integrating \\nthe specific properties of various solder pastes could refine the system's \\nprediction of the reflow process, ensuring better control over the melting \\nand solidification stages. \\no Granular Temperature Profiles:More detailed control over the \\nindividual heating zones within the reflow oven could allow for finer \\nadjustments to the thermal profile. This feature would enable the system \\nto better accommodate PCBs with varying thermal mass, ensuring uniform \\nheating across all board areas. \\no Component-Specific Heat Sensitivity:Each component on a PCB has \\ndifferent heat absorption and dissipation characteristics. By accounting for \\ncomponent-specific thermal tolerances, such as heat-sensitive ICs or larger \\ncomponents like capacitors, the system could create custom temperature \\nprofiles tailored to the PCB's component layout, reducing the risk of \\noverheating delicate components.\"),\n",

Higher copper density requires more \\nenergy to reach optimal soldering temperatures, while lower density may \\nresult in faster heating. Incorporating copper density into the model would \\nimprove the accuracy of heat distribution predictions. \\no Component Size Variations:The size of individual components can affect \\nhow they respond to heat during the reflow process. Smaller \\ncomponents tend to heat and cool faster than larger ones. Incorporating \\ncomponent size data would allow the system to adapt temperature profiles \\nbased on these differences, ensuring each component is treated according \\nto its specific heat tolerance. \\n \\n4. Cloud Integration: \\n \\nWhile the current system is a desktop application, integrating the system with \\ncloud services could open up new possibilities for scalability and collaboration. \\nBy moving data storage and model processing to the cloud, the system could: \\no Handle larger datasets: Storing and processing larger amounts of data in \\nthe cloud would enable the system to work with much larger datasets, \\nimproving model accuracy and providing more comprehensive training  \\ndata. \\no Enable remote access : With cloud integration, users would be able to \\naccess the system from anywhere, collaborate across multiple locations, \\nand run predictions without being tied to a specific desktop setup. \\no Scalability: Cloud-based infrastructure would make it easier to scale the \\nsystem for use in larger manufacturing environments, where multiple users \\nand reflow  ovens may need to access the  same dataset and prediction \\nmodels. \\n \\n5. Enhanced Machine Learning Models: \\n \\nFuture versions of the system could explore the use of more advanced machine \\nlearning techniques, such as: \\no Ensemble models: Combining the predictions  of multiple mode ls to \\ncreate more accurate and stable predictions. \\no Transfer learning: Using pre -trained models on similar tasks and fine -\\ntuning them for the specific task of predicting reflow oven parameters, \\nwhich could  reduce the time required  for training and improve model \\nperformance. \\no Self-learning capabilities: Allowing the system to update and \\nimprove the models over time by learning from user feedback and new \\ndata collected during production runs. \\n \\nBy pursuing these improvements, the Reflow Oven Profile Predictor can continue to \\nevolve into a more powerful and versatile tool for optimizing the PCB manufacturing \\nprocess, providing users with greater accuracy, flexibility, and scalability.\"),\n",

This ensured that every task was traceable, minimizing errors and ensuring \\nreliability. I adopted this habit by diligently recording my work on the Feeders Management \\nSystem, which taught me the importance of taking responsibility for my actions. \\nAdditionally, ethical practices extended to sustainability. With  certifications like ISO 14001, \\nGPV Lanka demonstrated a commitment to environmental responsibility. This inspired me to \\nconsider the broader impact of my work, whether by reducing waste or designing more energy-\\nefficient solutions. \\nProfessionalism was als o evident in punctuality, clear communication, and adherence to \\ndeadlines. By emulating these traits, I learned to approach my tasks with discipline and focus. \\nOverall, ethical practices and professionalism shaped my understanding of how to contribute \\nmeaningfully to an industrial environment while upholding values that foster trust and \\ncollaboration. \\n4.2  NON-TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THE WORK \\nWhile technical knowledge is crucial in any engineering role, my experience at GPV Lanka \\nshowed me the valu e of non -technical skills in ensuring smooth operations. These skills \\nincluded effective communication, teamwork, time management, and adaptability. \\nOne of the most significant non-technical skills I developed was communication. Working on \\nprojects like th e Feeders Management System required me to collaborate with engineers, \\nproduction workers, and my mentor, Mr. Janith Kongahage. I learned to explain my ideas \\nclearly, listen to feedback, and adjust my approach based on input from others. This skill not \\nonly improved my confidence but also enhanced my ability to work in a team.'),\n",
