### Stage 2: Building a Simple Conversational Agent
- **Objective**: Craft a basic conversational AI agent that processes queries and retains state.
- **Highlights**:
  - Build a multi-node graph with a language model node and response handler.
  - Utilize `HumanMessage` and `SystemMessage` for smooth conversation flow.
  - Add conditional edges for dynamic routing based on user input.
- **Why It Matters**: Showcases LangGraph‚Äôs ability to enable context-aware chats with simplicity.
